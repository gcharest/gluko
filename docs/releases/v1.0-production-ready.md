# Milestone v1.0: Production Ready

## Overview

v1.0 marks the transition from experimental (pre-1.0) to production-ready. All core features are implemented, tested, stable, and accessible. The app is suitable for regular use by individuals managing diabetes as a reference and calculation tool.

### ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This application is NOT certified by health authorities and should NOT be used as an official medical application.** Gluko is a guide and calculation tool for carbohydrate counting. Users must:

- Exercise careful review of all calculations and recommendations
- Consult healthcare providers before making changes to diabetes management
- Never replace professional medical advice with this application
- Verify nutritional data against reliable sources
- Understand that data sources may contain errors

Use this app as a supplementary tool, not as a substitute for professional medical guidance.

- [ ] **No ESLint violations** (strict linting enforced)
- [ ] **TypeScript strict mode compliant** (no type errors, all exported APIs typed)
- [ ] **CI/CD workflows green** (code quality, accessibility, deployment)

### Documentation Complete

- [ ] **All release docs accurate** (v0.1-v0.6 reflect actual implementation)
- [ ] **RELEASE_TRACKER.md up-to-date** (features mapped with status)
- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE.md aligned with reality** (no documentation-reality gaps)
- [ ] **Implementation docs exist** for major features
- [ ] **User-facing help/docs** (in-app guidance, FAQ, or standalone docs)
- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING.md** (clear guidance for contributors)

### Cross-Browser & Device Testing

- [ ] **Tested on multiple browsers**:
  - Chrome/Chromium (Android + Desktop)
  - Safari (iOS + macOS)
  - Firefox (Desktop + Android)
- [ ] **Tested on multiple device classes**:
  - Low-end Android (< 4GB RAM, slower CPU)
  - Mid-range Android (4-6GB RAM)
  - iPhone 12+ (representative iOS device)
  - Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- [ ] **Responsive design validated** (320px to 1920px width)
- [ ] **Touch and keyboard interactions work** (no input modality left behind)

### Stability & Confidence

- [ ] **At least 2-4 weeks of stable pre-release usage** (dogfooding, beta testers)
- [ ] **No data loss issues reported** (IndexedDB migrations tested, backup/restore validated)
- [ ] **Battery consumption acceptable** on mobile devices (no background drain)
- [ ] **Performance acceptable on low-end devices** (tested on older hardware)
- [ ] **Reasonable confidence this won't need breaking changes soon** (API stable, data schema stable)

## Goals for v1.0

1. **Stability**: All features working reliably across devices and browsers
2. **Performance**: Consistently meet all Web Vitals targets
3. **Accessibility**: Full WCAG AA compliance
4. **Documentation**: Clear, accurate, and complete for users and developers
5. **Confidence**: Safe to recommend to the T1D community

---

## Success Criteria

v1.0 is considered successful if:

- **Users trust it**: Can rely on the app daily without data loss
- **Performance is reliable**: Loads fast, responds quickly, works offline
- **Accessible to all**: Full keyboard and screen reader support
- **Well-documented**: Clear codebase and user guidance
- **Community-ready**: Can be recommended to diabetes communities

---

## Non-Goals for v1.0

The following are explicitly deferred:

- **Backend sync / cloud backup** (future)
- **Multi-device synchronization** (future)
- **Advanced features**: meal templates, nutrient trends, advanced filters (future)
- **Theme customization** (dark mode, custom colors)
- **Internationalization beyond EN/FR** (additional languages)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Performance targets not met on low-end devices

**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (blocks v1.0)  
**Mitigation**:

- Implement Web Workers in v0.4 to avoid main thread blocking
- Test early and often on representative low-end devices
- Use Lighthouse CI in v0.2 to catch regressions

### Risk: Data loss during migrations

**Likelihood**: Low (if tested properly)  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Mitigation**:

- Implement backup/restore in v0.6
- Test all IndexedDB migrations with real user data
- Add migration rollback capability

### Risk: Browser compatibility issues

**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:

- Test on all target browsers in v0.2+
- Use progressive enhancement (core features work everywhere, enhancements where supported)
- Document known limitations in release notes

### Risk: Extended timeline (v0.2-v0.6 takes longer than expected)

**Likelihood**: High  
**Impact**: Low (quality > speed)  
**Mitigation**:

- Accept that v1.0 may take 6-12 months from current state
- Focus on incremental value delivery (each v0.x is usable)
- Don't rush to v1.0 — ship when truly ready

---

## Post-v1.0 Roadmap

### v1.1+: Refinements & Quality of Life

- Advanced search filters (by food group, nutrient ranges)
- Meal templates (save common meals for quick re-use)
- Dark mode / theme customization
- Batch operations (multi-select in history)
- Performance optimizations based on real-world usage

### v2.0: Sync & Multi-Device

- Optional backend sync (preserve offline-first)
- Cloud backup and restore
- Multi-device synchronization
- Account management (optional, privacy-respecting)

### Future Considerations

- Additional language support
- Integration with health data sources
- Community-contributed food databases

---

## Transition from v0.x to v1.0

### What Changes at v1.0?

- **Semantic Versioning**: v1.0+ follows semver strictly (breaking changes = major bump)
- **API Stability**: IndexedDB schema and data format considered stable (migrations required for changes)
- **Support Commitment**: v1.x will receive bug fixes and security updates
- **Documentation**: User-facing docs and developer guides considered complete

### What Stays the Same?

- **No-backend architecture**: Still a PWA, still offline-first
- **Open source**: License unchanged
- **Privacy-first**: No telemetry, no cloud requirement, user data stays local
