# Release v0.5: UI Polish & Accessibility

## Release Summary

Refine and optimize the user interface across all views (search, calculator, history, settings) to improve usability, accessibility, and visual consistency based on user feedback and accessibility testing.

## Goals

1. **Search view optimization**: Faster search results, better result presentation, keyboard shortcuts
2. **Calculator view refinement**: Clearer input flow, better serving size selection, instant feedback
3. **History view enhancement**: Better organization, filtering, quick re-use of previous meals
4. **Settings/subject management**: Clearer subject creation and switching
5. **Accessibility improvements**: WCAG AA compliance across all views, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
6. **Visual consistency**: Unified design language, responsive layouts for all device sizes

## Constraints Specific to This Release

- **No data model changes**: UI only, keep existing IndexedDB schema
- **Performance**: UI improvements must not degrade Web Vitals
- **Accessibility**: Must meet WCAG AA standards
- **Mobile-first**: Design optimizations for small screens
- **Bilingual**: All UI changes must support EN/FR seamlessly

## Options Considered

### Option A: Minor tweaks only

- **Approach**: Small improvements to existing layouts (button placement, colors, etc.)
- **Pros**: Low effort, quick wins
- **Cons**: Doesn't address fundamental UX issues
- **Risk**: Low but insufficient

### Option B: Per-view redesign

- **Approach**: Redesign each view systematically (search, calculator, history, settings)
- **Pros**: Comprehensive improvements, addresses major UX issues
- **Cons**: More effort, requires user testing
- **Risk**: Medium (worth the investment)

### Option C: Complete app redesign

- **Approach**: Overhaul entire app layout, navigation, and interactions
- **Pros**: Best long-term UX
- **Cons**: High effort, risky, might introduce bugs
- **Risk**: High (too much change at once)

## Selected: Option B

**Why**: Systematically improve each view based on v0.1-v0.4 user feedback. Manageable scope while delivering meaningful UX improvements.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Search view: Results load within 500ms, clear carb display, favorites accessible
- [ ] Calculator view: Intuitive serving size selection, clear totals, easy to add/remove items
- [ ] History view: Organized by subject/date, one-click re-use, swipe to delete (mobile)
- [ ] Settings: Clear subject creation/switching, data management options
- [ ] Accessibility: Lighthouse accessibility score ≥ 95, keyboard navigation works throughout
- [ ] Responsiveness: Works well on 320px (small phone) to 800px (tablet) widths
- [ ] Bilingual: All new text properly translated EN/FR

## Known Risks

- **User testing bias**: Without real users, improvements might miss actual pain points → Gather feedback from beta testers
- **Scope creep**: "While we're at it" features → Keep focus on existing views only
- **Accessibility complexity**: WCAG AA requires thorough testing → Use axe DevTools and screen reader testing

## Out of Scope

- New features (those are v0.6+)
- Backend/cloud features
- Advanced analytics or reporting
- Theme customization (dark mode, etc.)
