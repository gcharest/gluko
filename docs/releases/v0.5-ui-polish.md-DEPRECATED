# Release v0.5: UI Polish & Accessibility

**⚠️ STATUS: DEPRECATED - Replaced by Complete Redesign**

This incremental polish approach has been superseded by [v0.5 Complete Redesign](v0.5-complete-redesign.md), which delivers all these improvements and more through a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul using modern design systems (Reka UI + Tailwind CSS).

**Decision Date**: 2025-12-19
**Rationale**: After completing v0.3's data infrastructure, the timing is optimal for a complete redesign that addresses both UI improvements AND performance optimization in a single cohesive release, rather than incremental Bootstrap enhancements.

**All original goals exceeded in v0.5**: Modern design system, mobile-first navigation, WCAG AA+ accessibility, enhanced search/calculator/history views, dark mode, and v0.4 performance optimizations integrated

See: [v0.5 Complete Redesign Release Plan](v0.5-complete-redesign.md)

## Original Release Summary (For Reference)

Refine and optimize the user interface across all views (search, calculator, history, settings) to improve usability, accessibility, and visual consistency based on user feedback and accessibility testing.

## Goals

1. **Search view optimization**: Faster search results, better result presentation, keyboard shortcuts
2. **Calculator view refinement**: Clearer input flow, better serving size selection, instant feedback
3. **History view enhancement**: Better organization, filtering, quick re-use of previous meals
4. **Settings/subject management**: Clearer subject creation and switching
5. **Accessibility improvements**: WCAG AA compliance across all views, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
6. **Visual consistency**: Unified design language, responsive layouts for all device sizes

## Constraints Specific to This Release

- **No data model changes**: UI only, keep existing IndexedDB schema
- **Performance**: UI improvements must not degrade Web Vitals
- **Accessibility**: Must meet WCAG AA standards
- **Mobile-first**: Design optimizations for small screens
- **Bilingual**: All UI changes must support EN/FR seamlessly

## Options Considered

### Option A: Minor tweaks only

- **Approach**: Small improvements to existing layouts (button placement, colors, etc.)
- **Pros**: Low effort, quick wins
- **Cons**: Doesn't address fundamental UX issues
- **Risk**: Low but insufficient

### Option B: Per-view redesign

- **Approach**: Redesign each view systematically (search, calculator, history, settings)
- **Pros**: Comprehensive improvements, addresses major UX issues
- **Cons**: More effort, requires user testing
- **Risk**: Medium (worth the investment)

### Option C: Complete app redesign

- **Approach**: Overhaul entire app layout, navigation, and interactions
- **Pros**: Best long-term UX
- **Cons**: High effort, risky, might introduce bugs
- **Risk**: High (too much change at once)

## Selected: Option B

**Why**: Systematically improve each view based on v0.1-v0.4 user feedback. Manageable scope while delivering meaningful UX improvements.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Search view: Results load within 500ms, clear carb display, favorites accessible
- [ ] Calculator view: Intuitive serving size selection, clear totals, easy to add/remove items
- [ ] History view: Organized by subject/date, one-click re-use, swipe to delete (mobile)
  - [ ] View full nutrient breakdown for each saved meal
  - [ ] Edit/modify a saved meal entry (nutrients, values, notes)
  - [ ] Delete a meal entry (with confirmation)
  - [ ] Quick duplicate/copy a meal to calculator
  - [ ] Filter/search history by date, subject, or meal name
- [ ] Settings: Clear subject creation/switching, data management options
- [ ] Accessibility: Lighthouse accessibility score ≥ 95, keyboard navigation works throughout
- [ ] Responsiveness: Works well on 320px (small phone) to 800px (tablet) widths
- [ ] Bilingual: All new text properly translated EN/FR

## Known Risks

- **User testing bias**: Without real users, improvements might miss actual pain points → Gather feedback from beta testers
- **Scope creep**: "While we're at it" features → Keep focus on existing views only
- **Accessibility complexity**: WCAG AA requires thorough testing → Use axe DevTools and screen reader testing

## Out of Scope

- New features (those are v0.6+)
- Backend/cloud features
- Advanced analytics or reporting
- Theme customization (dark mode, etc.)
