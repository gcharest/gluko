# Release v0.7: Advanced Features

## Release Summary

Add advanced functionality like meal templates, enhanced search filters, data visualization, and customization features to improve the power-user experience and extend functionality beyond core carb counting.

## Goals

1. **Meal templates**: Save and reuse common meals quickly
2. **Advanced search**: Filter by food group, nutrient ranges, macros
3. **Batch operations**: Multi-select and bulk actions in history
4. **Data visualization**: Charts/graphs for nutrient trends over time (optional)
5. **Customization**: Theme options, display preferences (optional)

## Constraints Specific to This Release

- **No backend still**: All features client-side
- **No breaking changes**: Must not break existing data or features
- **Performance**: Must not degrade Web Vitals targets
- **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG AA compliance
- **Optional features**: Features should be toggleable/progressive

## Options Considered

### Option A: Meal templates only

- **Approach**: Focus on saving/reusing common meals
- **Pros**: High-value feature, relatively simple
- **Cons**: Doesn't address other user requests
- **Risk**: Low

### Option B: Advanced search + meal templates

- **Approach**: Two high-value features
- **Pros**: Addresses common user needs
- **Cons**: More complex than Option A
- **Risk**: Low to medium

### Option C: Full feature suite (templates + search + viz + customization)

- **Approach**: All advanced features at once
- **Pros**: Comprehensive enhancement
- **Cons**: Large scope, may delay v1.0
- **Risk**: Medium to high (scope creep)

## Selected: Optional - To Be Determined Based on User Feedback

Implement based on actual user requests post-v1.0 rather than speculation. Start with meal templates as the highest-value feature if demand justifies it.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Meal templates feature:
  - Save current meal as template
  - Load template into calculator
  - Edit/delete templates
  - Template management UI
- [ ] (Optional) Advanced search filters:
  - Filter by food group
  - Filter by nutrient ranges (e.g., carbs < 20g)
  - Sort by different nutrients
- [ ] (Optional) Batch operations in history:
  - Multi-select in history
  - Bulk delete
  - Bulk export
- [ ] (Optional) Data visualization:
  - Simple charts (carbs over time, etc.)
  - Configurable date ranges
- [ ] (Optional) Customization features:
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Display density options
  - Preferred units

## Known Risks

- **Scope creep**: Easy to add too many features at once → Prioritize based on user feedback
- **User demand uncertainty**: May build features users don't want → Gather feedback before implementing
- **Complexity**: Each feature adds maintenance burden → Evaluate cost/benefit carefully

## Out of Scope

- Cloud sync (requires backend)
- AI/ML meal suggestions (future)
- Integration with external services (future)
